    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, 

    #Next we want to output the countries which this is simple, we got to keep in mind the diffrent countries in diffrent months.
    country,

    #Now we are checking how many transaction where done again this is going to be group by the month which is stated at the bottom.
    COUNT(*) AS trans_count, 

    #Now here is where I used the case format, we are count if where the state = aprroved then adding them all up in groups of year and month and country (COUNT() can also be used just need to change 0 to NULL).
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 end ) AS approved_count, 

    #Now we sum up all the transaction no matter approved or declined still group by year and month/country.
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, 

    #Now we sum up the amount only where state is approved.
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 end) AS approved_total_amount


#Only checking in 1 table no need for joining anything so simply (Tranactions).
FROM Transactions

#Now this is the important part!! Group it by the year and month and then the country so all the aggreation reads it by these rules.
