# We want to select the customer number
SELECT customer_number

# From the only table which is Orders
FROM Orders 

# We want to group it by the customer_number in order to count whihc has the highest
GROUP BY customer_number 

# Then we order it by the Count function in order to count each and we put it in desc order from greatest to least
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_number) desc

# So after we limit the output to just 1 so we only see the highest count. 
LIMIT 1
