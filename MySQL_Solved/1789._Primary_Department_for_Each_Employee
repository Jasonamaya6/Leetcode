#Selecting the two ids 
SELECT employee_id, department_id

#From the employee's table
FROM Employee

#This is where you check if the flag is Y or N which determines whether or not the 
#if that id is the primary so we check if the value = to Y 
# However some don't have a Y and only have one value which is equal to N 
WHERE primary_flag = "Y" or employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employee 
    group by employee_id
    having count(employee_id) = 1
) # Here is where we make a subquery to check if the count of the employee id is one which thsi would be the Primary.
