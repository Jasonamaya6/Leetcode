# Hard to comprehen however it makes sense when breaking it down.


# We want to select the max salary right now however in the where clause we are going to meet this condition because this max(salary only returns one number) 
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 

#We are selecting it from the employees table
FROM employee 

#Now here is where we set the selected salary less then the subquery of the max of the column 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);



# Suppose we have a set of { 100, 200, 300 } 

# Select max(salary) = 300 curently

# However after we set the where condition we are filtering all the val;ues that are less then 300 which is {100, 200}

#However back to the SELECT MAX(salary) the new max is 200 and selects that as the output.
