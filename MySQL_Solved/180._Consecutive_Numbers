# Find the numbers that appear consecutively 3 times in a row and ouput it.

# We want select the rows that the number will appear however we want to 
# only just ditsinct one number not all of the occurences whish is why DISTINCT is there.
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as consecutiveNums 

# We want to initialize the begining occurance of the number and from there check 
# the next two spots if their the same, so Log l1 is the esstinally the head.
FROM Logs l1

# Here we join the l1 id is = to the l2.id from a +1 postion.
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.id = l2.id + 1
# Here we do the same operation but for this time from +2 postions meaning its 3rd occurance.
JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.id = l3.id + 2

# Now we want to ouput only where the numbers where their equal to eachother.
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num
